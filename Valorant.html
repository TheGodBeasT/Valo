    <h2> Origin</h2>
    <p>Teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on
        April 7, 2020, followed by a release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant
        takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the
        buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</p>
